# Keylogger Detector

üîç **Keylogger Detector** is a simple application designed to detect potential keyloggers, suspicious processes, and abnormal network activity on a Windows machine. It continuously monitors system processes, keyboard activity, and network connections to identify any malicious behavior associated with keyloggers or surveillance software.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Process Monitoring**: Detects suspicious processes related to keyloggers or spyware by checking running processes for keywords like "keylog", "logger", "sniffer", and more.
- **Keylogging Behavior Detection**: Monitors keyboard activity, and if abnormal keystrokes (e.g., 50 key presses in 10 seconds) are detected, it flags this as potential keylogger behavior.
- **Network Activity Monitoring**: Tracks network activity for suspicious connections on ports commonly used by malicious software (e.g., ports 21, 23, 445, 3389) and checks for unusual remote IPs outside of trusted DNS services.
